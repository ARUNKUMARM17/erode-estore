  "description": "Philips OneBlade has a revolutionary technology designed for beard grooming. It can trim, Style and also shave any length of hair (Does not shave as close as manual razors as blade doesn't touch skin). Its dual protection system – a glide coating combined with rounded tips – makes the experience easier and comfortable. OneBlade is powered by a turbo charged cutter (12000x per min) so it's efficient - even on longer hairs.\nCreate precise edges and clean lines with the dual-sided blade. You can use in either direction to get great visibility and see every hair that you're cutting. Line up your style in seconds!\nTrim your beard to a precision stubble length with one of the included 3 stubble combs. 1mm for a 5 o'clock, 3mm for a tight trim, and 5mm for a long stubble.\nOneBlade is fully waterproof, so it is easy to clean: just rinse it under the tap. You can shave wet or dry, even in the shower - whichever you prefer. No shaving foam necessary\nCan be charged at home or on the road, perfect for your daily routine. Also comes with a protective cover, making it your perfect travel companion\nDurable stainless steel blade that lasts up to 4 months of use* to keep that fresh feel. When the replacement indicator - eject icon - will appear on the blade, the blade performance may no longer be optimal. It is time to consider changing the blade for the best shaving experience",
